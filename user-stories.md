# User Stories (Calendar UI)

## 1. Current month visibility

As a user, I want to see the current month displayed in the calendar  
so that I immediately know which month I’m viewing.

## 2. Navigate to previous month

As a user, I want to view the previous month by clicking a left-arrow button  
so that I can easily review past dates.

## 3. Navigate to next month

As a user, I want to view the next month by clicking a right-arrow button  
so that I can plan upcoming events.

## 4. Boundary handling for months

As a user, I want the calendar to prevent navigation beyond valid month limits (no undefined first/last month states)  
so that navigation remains logical and error-free.

## 5. Year/month selector

As a user, I want to click the year/month label or button  
so that I can switch to a full-year overview.

## 6. Choose a specific year

As a user, I want to select a year and see all 12 months in a grid  
so that I can quickly jump to any month in that year.

## 7. Select a month from year view

As a user, I want clicking a month in the selected year to open that month’s day view  
so that I can see all the dates for that month.

## 8. Day selection feedback

so that I know which date is currently chosen.
